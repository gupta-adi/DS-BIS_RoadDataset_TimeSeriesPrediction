# RoadDataset-TimeSeriesPrediction

By - Aditya Gupta

This repository demonstrates Time Series Prediction on Road Dataset of nearly 25Kms

Task: We are using a 10-year dataset from an IoT sensor on the road to estimate the metrics Para-9, Para-10, Para-11, Para-12, and Para-13 for year 10.

Model Used: Transformed the Data into Train and Test Dataset, by extracting 10th year data for para 9-13 for every section. We have used Light Gradient Boosting Machine(LGBM) for solving this problem.

Result: The RMSE value - 68.76
